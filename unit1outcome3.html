            <p class="text">When making my website, there was definitely room for working more efficiently. Since I don’t have access to Visual Studio Code at home, I could have organised and planned out the layout of the website when I was in class. On the other hand, I could spent time to type up the content when at home. To do this, I sent my word document over through Slack in my private channel. This way I could assess my work from home and class.
                </p>
            <p class="text">If we were in a team to create a website, the productivity could potentially be quicker. The team would need to be split into different roles e.g. designer and coder. However, the troubles you would encounter is although everyone could chip in ideas on the web-design, it is difficult to work collaboratively when using Visual Studio Code since you can’t really have multiple people working on the same file on different computers. This would lead to some of the team not having anything to do once their job has been complete.

            <h2 class="header-two">3.2</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three"> Describe ways to improve productivity & efficiency</h3>
            <p class="text">To improve my productivity and efficiency, I found it was important to plan in some breaks. This is because I found after working for a couple hours straight I started to feel rather sluggish, which was hindering my working speed. This lead to less work being completed at the end of the day. By implementing breaks, it will give me time to freshen up and allow for time to reflect on what tasks I have completed or need doing next. 

                    In regards to working more efficiently, I found typing up the answers to the questions first and sorting out the layout of the website secondly was a quicker and more organised method. This is because, with the typed up content in hand, I could mess around with the way I wanted the website to look. Once I was happy with how everything was played out, I could simply copy and paste the answers into HTML. Possibly make a few minor changes if the size of the content shifts the layout.</p>

            <h3 class="header-three"> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
            <p class="text">I think working in a team would make it easier to develop sites. Next time I will collaborate using Slack.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">3.4</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
            <p class="text">I would test my website by using it in different browsers to see if everything functioned properly. The CSS sometimes changed in different browsers so I would need to fix my code so that it is compatible with all browsers. 

                    I would test the navigation menu by checking all the links worked manually and making sure they took the user to the correct websites. </p>
