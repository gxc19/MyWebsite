            <h3 class="header-three">Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
            <p class="text">In total, I have 6 pages for my website: home, about me, unit 1 outcome 1-3, and unit 2 outcome 1. At the top of the page, I have a navigation bar with a drop down options to reveal outcome 1-3. The colour of the navigation bar is different in colour for each page to best suit the background theme for aesthetics. For the background, I decided to go with a pixel GIF background. This is because at the time of designing, I was really into the whole look of pixel art. On top of that, having a GIF as a background would make the pages look more alive. At the top centre, below the  navigation bar, the title of each page was displayed in large text in a stylish font. Underneath the title, is where all the text boxes are aligned underneath one another. Each text box has the question with my answer. Similar situation with the navigation, the choice for the colour scheme was decided based on the colour theme of the background.</p>

            <h3 class="header-three">Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
            <p class="text">Copyright are legal rights which are given to the owner in order to protect their work. This prevents others from trying to use the authors work without their permission. The types of work which can be protected by copyright include: books, paintings, photographs, music, films, songs, computer software, and many more.</p>
            <p class="text">Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict the web-designer on what they are able to publish on the website, such as adding images off of Google. In order for the web-designer to avoid this from happening is to have permission from the author/creator of the source. This would save any legal actions which may occur in the future. Adding a reference, where you found the source would also help.

            <h3 class="header-three">Describing access issues that need taking into account</h3>
            <p class="text">When designing a website, it is important to take into account for the people who may have disabilities which may affect the way they can access and use the website the way it was intended. Disabilities which web-designers should take into account are: blindness, vision loss, colour blindness, and deaf or heard of hearing</p>
            <p class="text">Someone who is blind won’t be able to view the graphics displayed on the screen. A way around this is to have a speech output system (e.g. screen readers) to read the text currently displayed on screen, aloud.</p>
            <p class="text">Similar problem with blindness, individuals who have vision loss have issues in regards to: low or poor colour contrasts, small icons, and type faces. To combat this, a screen enlarger software to display text and icons much larger to view, a colour and contrast adjuster, and lastly a speech output system will better the user experience.</p>
            <p class="text">Someone who is colourblind will have difficulty seeing certain colours. This leads to colours being mixed up and having a hard time differentiating colours from one another. This would mean the colour of the text and the background colour is something important to consider. To over come this, the web-designer should avoid particular colour combinations such as green/red, green/brown, blue/purple and many more. In addition a colour filter option could be implemented onto the website.</p>
            <p class="text">Someone who is deaf or hard of hearing would have difficulties from hearing audible materials. To over come this, the website should focus more on visual prompts. </p>

            <h2 class="header-two">1.7</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
            <p class="text">The best file types for websites are: JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG.</p>
            <p class="text">JPEG (Joint Photographic's Expert Group) is the most popular choice for saving photographs because it is able to capture a wider range of colours, leading to a more colour accurate image.
                </p>
            <p class="text">Whether you’re using PNG-8 or PNG-24, depends on how much colour is able to be captured. PNG-8 is able to capture up to 256 different colours, where as PNG-24 can capture an unlimited amount of colours. In addition, PNG has control over transparency which is perfect for logos.</p>
            <p class="text">GIF can’t capture as many colours in comparison to JPEG or PNG, however GIF can be animated.</p>
            <p class="text">SVG are built using mathematical formulas instead of pixels, making it a poor choice for pictures. However, they are good for drawings and line art.</p>
