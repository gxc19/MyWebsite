            <h3 class="header-three">Describe the purpose of IT in modern businesses</h3>
            <p class="text">The purpose of IT in modern businesses has many uses. The existence of IT is what allows computers and peripherals such as printers and scanners to work. With IT improving over the years, it has made businesses be able to operate more efficiently. The use of computers such as desktop machines, laptops and smart phones allow the users to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research and many more. Overall, it helps to organise businesses whilst reducing the work load and increasing accuracy.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">1.2</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">Describe the methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
            <p class="text">The skills involved in digital project management are: strong communication skills, problem solver,  and strong organisation skills.
            </p>
           
            <p class="text">Strong communication skills are important, especially when working in a team. By communicating with your team mates, you’ll be able to balance out the work load between one another by organising specific who completes what task. This leads to the team working more efficiently, and as a result, the work being completed faster.
                </p>
            <p class="text">Having the ability to problem solve would help you when working on your own task or project. This will prevent you from having to constantly ask for help from someone in your team. This means that the individual who is spending time helping you, would lose time completing their own task. This would overall slow down the speed in which the project is being completed.
                </p>
            <p class="text">Organisation skills would benefit individuals in being more productive in their work. By creating a plan, you’ll be able to keep on track what you have and haven’t done, as well as help break down large projects which would be helpful if working in a team. An example of a tool you could use is Trello, which is a web-based Kanban styled list making application.

            <h2 class="header-two">1.3</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">How will you plan out to carry out tasks using IT?</h3>
            <p class="text">In order to plan and carry out tasks using IT, individuals can make use of Trello, which is a web-based Kanban styled list making application, to help organise tasks that need completing. This is especially efficient when you’re working in a groups. Roles can be assigned to individuals to keep the work flow going and makes sure to balance out the work load throughout the group.

            <h3 class="header-three">Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
            <p class="text">There are many reasons which may lead to the failure of a digital project. One example is the lack of management. This leads to parts of the team having a lot of freedom in their work which may end up not following their business objectives, resulting in confusion and lack of interest.
                    Lack of planning can also result in the failure of a digital project. The aims the business is planning to achieve would be foggy and unclear to the team, resulting in confusion.

            <h2 class="header-two">1.5</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
            <p class="text">In order to know if you have selected the right technology for the job, is to understand what the needs are from your client. By doing so, you’ll be able to take a different approach which is more specific in targeting the assigned job.

            <h3 class="header-three">Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you</h3>
            <p class="text">I have chosen to use Trello to help keep me organised whilst creating my website. Trello has been a big help in mapping out how i want the website design too look like, which is a smarter move in comparison to jumping straight into coding the website. In addition, been able to break down the project into small tasks allowed me to visually see what remaining task i still need to complete and the tasks i have completed.</p>
