            <h3 class="header-three">Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
            <p class="text">The current tools I’m using to create my website are Visual Studio Codes and Trello to plan everything out. Overall I am happy with the tools I am using to create my website. I prefer Visual Studio Codes a lot more compared to Codepen because VS Code seems to be more responsive with its colour change when typing out commands. To view the changes I made with the coding in HTML and CSS, I opened the website on a live server.</p>
            <p class="text">With Trello, before jumping into HTML and CSS, I planned out how I wanted the website to look. I achieved this by creating tasks with a description to further explain the design choice.  </p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2 class="header-two">2.2</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">Describe whether the IT tools selected are appropriate</h3>
            <p class="text">I feel Visual Studio Code’s was an appropriate IT tool to build my website. This is because I have had previous experience with using the program when using Javascript.</p>
            <p class="text">On the other hand, with Trello, I feIt I wasn’t really making full use of it. Once I got the main template figured out on Trello, having to update it with the changes I made to the website when using CSS seemed a bit of a hassle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2 class="header-two">2.3</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">Strengths & weaknesses of your final project</h3>
            <p class="text">The positives about my website is I have a navigation bar at the top of the screen, which is commonly used on all well known sites. With the design aesthetics, for the text box and background colour, I made sure the colour scheme complimented each other. Additionally, I made sure that the text is readable by giving each text box a different colour, this helped to prevent the text from being drowned by the background. In addition, I have decided to use the same style font for the headings through out the pages. This is to make my website look more professional. </p>
            <p class="text">With the negatives about my website, it is rather simplistic with not many features present. There is also a lack of images which makes the website look rather dull.</p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2 class="header-two">2.4</h2>
            <h3 class="header-three">Describe future improvements you can make to your project</h3>
            <p class="text">This being my first website, there is definitely room for improvement. For the unit 1 & 2 pages, I would add smooth scroll so the user of the website won’t need to manually scroll down the page to look for the specific information they’re looking for. More images implemented to each page to balance out the text.</p>
