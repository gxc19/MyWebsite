        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>My name is Ga Ming. Originally I was going to be called William but our neighbours and the time recommended my parents to name me Ga Ming instead. 
        For high school I went to Abbey Gate College and stayed there through the whole of sixth form. During my time in sixth form I studied Business Studies, Design Technology and did an EPQ. 
        Hobby wise I do enjoy doing DIY (do It yourself) related things since I like making things. Also, I enjoy drawing but haven’t really been drawing anything  lately her since I was put off from GCSE art. However, I definitely would like to get back into it, just need to stop procrastinating and push myself to get back into it.

        <h4>Interests in technology & coding</h4>
        <p>As a whole, all sorts of technology has been implemented into our everyday lives. I find technology interesting because it shows how far we have come in developing new technology and gives us an idea on what we could exspect in the future. Whether it's to smart phones or improve research tools and machines to explore outter space.
        </p>
        <p>When you hear someone say the words coding, I always thought it sounded pretty cool and was like about hacking into things. Only recently I have gained an interest in doing coding after my friend recommended me to join Code Nation. I feel I have definitely been more informed on what coding is all about and how it's used.</p>

    <div>
        <h4>How did I find out about Code Nation?</h4>
        <p>I first heard of Code Nation when my friend John mentioned it to me during class in lower sixth, talking about the benefits and what they had to offer. It was something that sparked an interested but wasn’t something I thought I would do as a career at the time. Fast forward to the end of upper sixth, I didn’t want to go to 
            university as I felt it wasn’t for me. Coming to October, John asked me whether I wanted to come to the open evening to Code Nation, in which I gladly took the offer. After hearing from Dan and Ian, I felt joining the course would be a good choice and a great career path to follow.

        <h4>How have I found it so far?</h4>
        <p>Similar to the majority, when joining the course,  I had no background in any sort of coding and was unclear on what to expect. Learning JavaScript on our first week, I felt it was pretty good. Of course there were times I struggled and required me to ask for help or search online for a solution. This was to be expected though 
            since learning code is like learning a new language. The more time and practise you put into it, the easier it will become. On week 2, we got split into 2 teams in which we had to design a coffee app. Since I like the design aspect I definitely had a blast with this coursework.
